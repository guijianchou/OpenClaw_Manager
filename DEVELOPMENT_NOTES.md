# OpenClaw Development Notes

## WinUI 3 Window Chrome And Theme Sync

This note records the debugging lesson from the v3.0.4 top-edge artifact fix.

### Symptom

The main window showed a 1px line at the very top of the custom title bar. On first launch in light mode the line appeared lighter than the title-bar surface. After switching between dark and light themes, the same edge could become black.

### Root Cause

The artifact was not a normal XAML border. It came from mixing three different ownership layers for the same visual edge:

- XAML title-bar surface (`AppTitleBar`)
- WinUI `AppWindow.TitleBar`
- native DWM caption and border attributes

The earlier `TopEdgeCover` workaround made the problem harder to reason about because it painted another 1px layer over the window. Removing that cover alone was not enough, because DWM still owned the real non-client border.

The stable fix was to make every layer use the same concrete color:

- `AppTitleBar.Background`
- `AppWindow.TitleBar.BackgroundColor`
- `AppWindow.TitleBar.InactiveBackgroundColor`
- `DWMWA_CAPTION_COLOR`
- `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR`

Avoid relying on `Colors.Transparent` for title-bar surfaces that are not caption buttons. Avoid `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR = COLOR_NONE` when the visual goal is a seamless colored top edge; set an explicit border color instead.

### Debugging Rules

- Treat custom title-bar artifacts as a multi-layer problem first, not as a XAML layout problem.
- Sample pixels from screenshots before changing code. A 1px white, black, or mismatched line usually reveals whether XAML, Mica, or DWM owns the visible edge.
- Do not cover native frame bugs with an extra XAML strip unless the native layer has already been proven impossible to control.
- Theme changes must go through the full native frame refresh path. Updating only managed XAML colors can leave DWM using stale light/dark state.
- Keep the main window and settings window on the same `WindowFrameHelper` contract so fixes do not diverge.

### Implementation Checklist

When changing window chrome or theme behavior:

1. Update the XAML title-bar surface.
2. Update `AppWindow.TitleBar` foreground, background, inactive, hover, and pressed colors.
3. Update DWM immersive dark mode, caption color, text color, and border color.
4. Refresh the non-client frame after theme changes.
5. Verify both startup theme and runtime dark/light switching.

Commands used for baseline verification:

```powershell
dotnet build OpenClaw.sln -c Debug -p:Platform=x64 --no-restore
dotnet run --project tests\OpenClaw.Tests\OpenClaw.Tests.csproj -c Debug --no-restore
```

## System Tray Win32 Integration

This note records the v3.1.0 tray icon and right-click menu debugging path.

### Symptoms

The tray icon initially failed to appear after minimizing to tray. After the icon appeared, right-clicking the status-bar tray icon did not open the context menu and produced no visible error.

### Root Causes

The first failure came from mixed Win32 string marshalling. The service called explicit `*W` entry points such as `RegisterClassExW`, `CreateWindowExW`, `LoadImageW`, and `AppendMenuW`, but the `DllImport` declarations did not all specify `CharSet.Unicode`. That allowed the registered class name and created window class name to diverge, producing `CreateWindowExW` error `1407`.

The right-click failure had two separate causes:

- `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4` reports the mouse event in `LOWORD(lParam)` and the icon id in the high word. Comparing the whole `lParam` against `WM_CONTEXTMENU` or `WM_RBUTTONUP` ignores the right-click event.
- `TrackPopupMenu` needs an owner window that can participate in foreground activation. A message-only `HWND_MESSAGE` window is useful for receiving messages, but it is not a reliable owner for a visible popup menu. Use a hidden normal top-level window instead.

### Implementation Rules

- Every explicit Win32 `*W` import that accepts strings must declare `CharSet = CharSet.Unicode`.
- Keep the tray callback window alive for the entire tray icon lifetime and destroy it only during `TrayIconService.Dispose()`.
- When using `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`, decode the callback event with a low-word helper before dispatching mouse actions.
- Use a hidden normal owner window for `TrackPopupMenu`; do not pass `HWND_MESSAGE` as the menu owner.
- Keep right-click tray commands minimal: Open OpenClaw, Settings, and Exit. Left-click can remain the quick show/hide toggle.

Regression coverage now checks the Unicode imports, `LOWORD(lParam)` callback parsing, the minimal tray command set, and the hidden normal owner-window requirement.

## Single Instance Launch Coordination

v3.1.1 keeps `AllowMultipleInstances` off by default because the common Windows workflow is one remote OpenClaw client parked in the tray. The setting lives under Settings > Advanced as "Multiple instances"; when enabled, launches keep the existing behavior and create another app window.

When multiple instances are disabled, startup creates a named mutex and the primary instance listens on a named pipe for activation requests. A secondary launch loads settings first, detects the mutex owner, sends an activation request to the primary instance, and exits. The primary dispatches that request back to the UI thread and calls `MainWindow.ActivateFromExternalLaunch()`, which restores a tray-hidden window instead of creating another tray icon.

## Window Bounds Persistence

This note records the v3.1.2 fix for a main-window visibility failure after switching the machine to dedicated-GPU direct mode.

### Symptom

The process started normally, WebView2 initialized, and the taskbar/tray entry remained present, but the main window was not visible. Debug output only showed first-chance WinRT and cancellation exceptions; the application exited cleanly when closed.

### Root Cause

The persisted window bounds in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClaw\settings.json` had been overwritten while the window was minimized or hidden:

```json
{
  "windowWidth": 160,
  "windowHeight": 28,
  "windowLeft": -32000,
  "windowTop": -32000
}
```

Those coordinates are Windows minimized-window sentinel values, not a user-visible placement. After a display topology change such as dedicated-GPU direct mode, restoring them can leave the WinUI window activated but effectively off-screen or collapsed.

### Implementation Rules

- Never persist bounds while the main window is hidden to tray or minimized.
- Treat `-32000`-style coordinates as invalid persisted state and reset them to the default visible bounds.
- Reject very small persisted sizes that match minimized caption-only dimensions.
- Before moving to saved coordinates, verify that the restored rectangle intersects one of the current `DisplayArea` work areas.
- If saved coordinates no longer intersect any display, center the window on the current display instead of trusting stale topology.

Regression coverage now checks both sides of the fix: settings load sanitizes minimized sentinel bounds, and `SaveWindowBounds()` skips hidden/minimized windows.
